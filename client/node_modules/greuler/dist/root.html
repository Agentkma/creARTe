<ul>
<li><code>target</code> A selector to the container to hold the graph</li>
<li><code>data</code> An object describing the properties of the graph<ul>
<li><code>data.nodes</code> The nodes of the graph, they need to have an <code>id</code></li>

<p>A full description of the properties can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/maurizzzio/greuler">README</a></p>
