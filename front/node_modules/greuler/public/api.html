  </script><p><code>instance.graph</code> holds utility methods to manipulate the graph like adding/removing
nodes and edges and other utility methods like querying the adjacent nodes of some node, etc.</p>
<p>The convention I used for the project is to <strong>always use objects as the first parameter to
describe a node or edge</strong> (an array/function is needed in some cases of some methods of
<code>instance.graph</code> but they describe multiple nodes/edges),
also all the methods of <code>instance.graph</code> (but the ones who add nodes and edges) receive a
single parameter</p>
<p>Please take a look at all the methods of <code>instance.graph</code> which can be found
<a href="https://github.com/maurizzzio/greuler/blob/master/src/Graph.js">here</a></p>

under the hood it uses <code>instance.graph</code> and wraps the returning values inside d3 selections
Just like <code>instance.graph</code> the first method will always be an object describing a node / edge,
the second parameter is an override of the styles predefined to be used during the animation</p>
